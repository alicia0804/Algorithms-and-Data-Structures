# Algorithms and Data Structures  
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures I studied and implemented during the semester.   It serves both as a personal learning archive and a reference for anyone interested in the fundamentals of computer science. 
## Topics Covered 
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, heapsort)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
- Hash tables
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
-  Redâ€“Black trees
  - and more...
  - ## About
    The implementations are primarily for educational purposes. While they may not always be fully optimized, they include comments and explanations to make the logic easier to follow and understand.    This repository is meant to track my progress and can also serve as a resource for students or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of algorithms and data structures.
